    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Loaded with 7 vegetables, this is the BEST Vegetarian Lasagna recipe! The cheese mixture is rich and creamy with spinach and ricotta, the vegetable tomato sauce is super robust, and everything gets sandwiched between layers of lasagna noodles and extra cheese. Perfect for the whole family!</p>
    <p>I love to sneak vegetables onto my kid’s plates in any way I can, and this Vegetarian Lasagna is hands down one of our family’s favorite dinners to make! I love it because it’s packed with 7 vegetables: spinach, tomatoes, mushrooms, carrots, celery, onion, and garlic. My kids love it because it tastes amazing. Pasta and cheese. Who doesn’t love that?!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul class="lasagna-ingredients">
        <li><strong>Cheese:</strong> I sprinkled both mozzarella and sharp cheddar cheese over the ricotta spinach mixture, and also on top of the lasagna before baking it in the oven. Cheddar adds a sharp tangy flavor and mozzarella gives us that amazing stretchy cheese texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Pasta:</strong>No boil lasagna noodles are perfect for this! They cut out an extra step in prep and they taste just like regular lasagna noodles! You can also substitute gluten-free lasagna noodles if needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Ricotta spinach mixture:</strong></li>
           <ul class="lasagna-ingredients">
             <li><strong>Spinach:</strong> I prefer to use fresh spinach, however, fresh or frozen spinach can be used.</li>
             <li><strong>Cheeses:</strong> Both ricotta and parmesan are needed here. Ricotta is rich and creamy, parmesan contrasts it with its sharpness.</li>
             <li><strong>Egg:</strong> Egg binds all of the other ingredients together and helps them not to separate into the other layers while baking.</li>
             <li><strong>Seasonings:</strong> I add garlic powder, onion powder, nutmeg, salt, and pepper to season. The taste is absolutely perfect.</li>
           </ul>
        <li><strong>Veggie loaded tomato sauce:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Butter & oil:</strong> I add these to the pan before I begin to sauté the vegetables. Butter adds flavor as well, it’s delicious!</li>
                <li><strong>Vegetables:</strong> I managed to pack 5 vegetables into this tomato sauce: mushrooms, carrots, celery, onion, and garlic are sliced and diced, and added. It is seriously veggie-loaded and healthy!</li>
                <li><strong>Tomatoes:</strong> Both crushed tomatoes and tomato sauce make for a robust tomato base. </li>
                <li><strong>Seasoning:</strong> I add Italian seasoning, along with some salt and pepper. Italian seasoning is the perfect blend of herbs to make this lasagna recipe taste authentic.</li>
                <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> Just a tablespoon of sugar brings out the sweetness in the tomatoes. Feel free to substitute it for honey or leave it out if you’d prefer.</li>
            </ul>
    </ul>
    <h3>Preparation:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Begin by preheating the oven to 350 degrees. In a small bowl combine the mozzarella and sharp cheddar cheese. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Add 1 tablespoon of oil to a large cast-iron pot and then add in spinach and cook until wilted.</li>
        <li>Add cooked spinach to a large bowl with ricotta, egg, parmesan cheese, garlic powder, onion powder, nutmeg, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. Mix well to combine.</li>
        <li>Add the oil and butter to the same pan the spinach was cooked in. Add in mushrooms and cook over medium-high heat until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Add carrots, celery, and onion to the skillet. Cook for 3-4 minutes or until the vegetables are golden brown. Stir in garlic and cook for an additional minute.</li>
        <li>Pour in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, Italian seasoning, and sugar. Stir to combine and simmer for 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Ladle 1/2 cup of the tomato sauce on the bottom of a casserole dish, and then in this order layer: 3 lasagna noodles (or as many as you can fit), 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture 1/3 of the mozzarella/cheddar shredded cheese and 1/4 of the sauce. Repeat until all of the sauce, noodles, and cheese are used making sure to use the remaining cheese for the topping.</li>
        <li>Bake for 40-45 minutes or until the lasagna is bubbling and golden brown on top. If it is starting to get too brown cover it with foil.</li>
        <li>Allow lasagna to cool for at least 20 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
    </ol>
