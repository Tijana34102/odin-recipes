    <h3>Description:</h3>
   <p>A step-by-step guide on how to make chia pudding, a delicious and healthy breakfast, snack, or dessert made in just 5 minutes with 4 only ingredients.</p>

   <p> This chia pudding is the best one I've tried so far! It's sweet, healthy, nutritious, and life-changing. Besides, it has such a satisfying creamy texture.</p>
   <br>
<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul class="chia-ingredients">
    <li>Unsweetened non-dairy milk: I used homade coconut milk.</li>
    <li>Maple or agave syrup.</li>
    <li>Vanilla extract: although this is an optional ingredient, it will make your chia pudding taste even better.</li>
    <li>Chia seeds: this is the main ingredient, so you can't replace it with anything else. Both white and black chia seeds are a good choice.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong>Add the wet ingredients to a mixing bowl (plant milk, syrup, and vanilla extract) and whisk until well combined.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 2:</strong>Incorporate the chia seeds and whisk again.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, ideally overnight.</li>
